				<h4>Our History</h4>
				<p>Founded in 2010 by landscape architect Melanie Taylor, Green Horizons Landscaping began as a small, family-run operation with a mission to redefine outdoor spaces while staying green. Initially focused on residential gardening, the company quickly earned a reputation for innovation and reliability, enabling expansion into commercial and large-scale landscaping projects.</p>
				<p>In 2015, Green Horizons took a bold step towards sustainability by committing to environmentally friendly practices. By 2020, the company had fully transitioned to using 100% electric equipment, from lawnmowers to transportation vehicles. With the sustainable development goals in mind, Green Horizons has significantly reduced its carbon footprint while maintaining the highest quality standards. Today, with a dedicated corporate office and a team of over 65 experts, Green Horizons Landscaping proudly serves thousands of clients while supporting the environment.</p>
